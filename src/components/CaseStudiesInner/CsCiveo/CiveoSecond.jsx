              Check-in delays, coordination between the front desk and housekeeping, and other camp operations proved challenging prior to the implementation of a camp management system
              </h4>
              <p className="cs-body mt-4">
              As a longtime partner of Camps & Crew, Civeo has always stood out as an early adopter of technology among remote
               workforce accommodations providers. The below bullets highlight some key operational challenges 
              Civeo faced prior to implementing software to streamline the management of their remote accommodations:
              </p>
              <ul className="cs-body pl-8 mt-4" style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>      
                <li>
                Lengthy check-in wait times were a frequent occurrence due to charter flight schedules that would result in the simultaneous arrival of 100+ workers at camp, overwhelming front desk staff and causing frustration for workers after long travel days.
                </li>
                <li>
                Suboptimal room utilization was a recurring issue due to limited real-time visibility into room availability.
                </li>
                <li>
                The booking process was decentralized, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies as different lodges used varied methods for room reservation creation. Some lodges would coordinate individual room reservations via lengthy email chains, while others would rely on oft-outdated passenger manifests to create room reservations.
                </li>
                <li>
                Poor coordination of room assignments was evident as the front desk and housekeeping teams struggled to communicate effectively regarding which rooms were ready for incoming guests.
                </li>
                <li>
                Broken communication between the front desk and housekeeping led to challenges coordinating room cleanings and assigning rooms, sometimes causing rooms not to be ready for workers checking in.
                </li>
                <li>
                Managing alcohol consumption in lounge areas presented a unique challenge, requiring manual monitoring and restrictions based on guest type and shift.
                </li>
                <li>
                The invoicing process was complicated by the lack of complete audit trails for reservation bookings and modifications, leading to questions regarding billing accuracy. This issue was further intensified considering the varied range of paying clients.
                </li>
              </ul>
